                    This research aims to develop flexible wing structures (FWS) that mimic bird wings, overcoming 
                    the current lack of development in this area.

                    <p>The use of SMAs could increase efficiency by eliminating 
                        some mechanical parts in current designs. Additionally,
                        adaptive machine learning interfaces could be used to predict
                        and adjust to environmental conditions in real-time, potentially
                        improving flight efficiency by more than 15.3% and reducing the risk of stalling.</p>

                
                    
                    <p>This would be achieved by using real-time sensor integration (RTSI) 
                        to gather environmental data and reinforcement learning algorithms to
                        adapt the wing configuration accordingly.</p>

                    <p>While discussing the potential of advancements in computing for UAVs and scaled aircraft,
                        we agreed on their unique advantages for future transport and automation. 
                        We delved into the current developments in UAVs and the gap between theoretical 
                        performance and physical testing. Our focus was on improving flight efficiency,
                        particularly through changes to the wing profile, which is crucial for sustaining flight.</p>

                    <p>Our initial plan was to incorporate feather-like dowels across the wing profile with a
                        tight-fitting polyester sheet overlaying it. However, after testing this feature in a subsonic
                        wind tunnel, we were disappointed with the results. The airflow across the airfoil surface seemed
                        to be warped due to the mesh area being slightly inward from the rigid body. This minor flaw led to the
                        formation of turbulent vortices near the trailing edge of the airfoil. Despite our attempts to install the 
                        mesh flush to the rigid body, we still noticed slight trailing and decided to abandon this idea.</p>
                    <img src="art/serwing.png" class="img-unheight mt-50" alt="" id="service-design">
                    <p>We also considered incorporating a piston-system as a passive lift mechanism at cruising altitude. This system was inspired by the flapping mechanism observed in the ascension frigatebird and older ornithopter gliders. We believed that a small piston system with a rotating actuator could generate lift passively at cruising altitude without exhaustive energy input. Our simulations showed a 14% greater lift force through pressure gradients and a larger divergence in the particles at the top and bottom boundary layers. However, the added cost and difficulty of implementing this mechanism were not justified by the physical performance it presented.</p>
                    <img src="art/orni.png" class="img-unheight mt-50" alt="" id="service-design">
                    <p>Another concept we abandoned was the inclusion of curved airfoil-based spikes on the upper surface and near the trailing edge of the airfoil. We thought this simple addition would maintain laminar flow and boundary control in high Reynoldâ€™s number environments and possibly enhance lift. However, our simulations showed confounding results. Structural analysis revealed that these projections were highly susceptible to breaking and unstable during high-altitude conditions. Furthermore, these projections could bend or possibly break at the cruising altitude of 25000 feet, common for UAVs like the MQ9, introducing increased turbulence and stalling. Given these potential issues, we decided not to use this design.</p>
